# Word-Guess-Game

This Great Gatsby themed hangman game asks the user to input letters in order to guess the word that pertains to the book. Based on the user's guess, a sound will ring out indicating whether or not their answer was in the word. If the user correctly guesses all of the letters, the game disappears and a positive Gatsby gif plays. One more button push brings the user badk to the start. If the user uses all of their chances, a sad image is displayed, and they can go back to the start with any button push.

Here is the deployed link to the game:
